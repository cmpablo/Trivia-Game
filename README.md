DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------

It's an 80s POP CULTURE TRIVIA GAME!
Test your knowledge in this timed Javascript quiz game.


HOW TO PLAY ------------------------------

Press the START button to begin.

You will be asked 11 questions and given 4 possible answers for each question. Better be quick because you only have 20 seconds to answer!

Answering correctly or incorrect takes you to the next question. If you run out of time, your unanswered tally goes up by one and moves to the next question.

Once the game is over, hit REPLAY to see if you do better, worse, or the same.

Good luck!
